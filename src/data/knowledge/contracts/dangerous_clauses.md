# Dangerous Contract Clauses (위험 조항 안내)

## Overview
This document identifies commonly found dangerous clauses in Korean real estate contracts and provides guidance on how to address them.

## High Risk Clauses (고위험 조항)

### 1. Excessive Early Termination Penalty

**Dangerous Example:**
"If the tenant terminates the contract early, 50% of the deposit shall be forfeited as penalty."

**Why It's Dangerous:**
- Exceeds reasonable penalty limits
- May be reduced by court under Civil Act Article 398
- Standard practice is 10-20% maximum

**Recommended Alternative:**
"Early termination requires 2 months notice. Penalty shall not exceed 10% of monthly rent equivalent or [specific reasonable amount]."

**Legal Reference:**
Civil Act Article 398 allows courts to reduce excessive penalties.

### 2. Unlimited Landlord Access

**Dangerous Example:**
"The landlord may enter the property at any time for inspection or maintenance purposes."

**Why It's Dangerous:**
- Violates tenant privacy rights
- No emergency exception defined
- Potential for harassment

**Recommended Alternative:**
"The landlord shall provide at least 24 hours advance notice for non-emergency inspections, which shall occur during reasonable hours (10:00-18:00 on weekdays). Emergency repairs are exempt from notice requirements."

**Legal Reference:**
Constitutional right to privacy; Housing Lease Protection Act implied protections.

### 3. Delayed Deposit Return

**Dangerous Example:**
"The deposit shall be returned within 60 days after the lease terminates and the tenant vacates."

**Why It's Dangerous:**
- Tenant may need funds for new housing
- Extended period may indicate financial problems
- Standard is 1-2 weeks

**Recommended Alternative:**
"The deposit shall be returned within 14 days of lease termination, provided the tenant has vacated and returned all keys. Any deductions shall be itemized in writing."

**Legal Reference:**
Housing Lease Protection Act; established court precedents.

### 4. Broad Tenant Liability

**Dangerous Example:**
"The tenant is responsible for all repairs and maintenance during the lease period regardless of cause."

**Why It's Dangerous:**
- Shifts landlord's legal obligations
- Includes structural issues beyond tenant control
- May include pre-existing defects

**Recommended Alternative:**
"The tenant is responsible for minor repairs under 300,000 KRW and damage caused by tenant negligence. The landlord is responsible for structural repairs, major systems, and pre-existing defects."

**Legal Reference:**
Civil Act landlord maintenance obligations.

---

### 5. Automatic Rent Increase

**Dangerous Example:**
"Rent shall automatically increase by 10% annually without further notice."

**Why It's Dangerous:**
- Exceeds legal limit of 5%
- No negotiation opportunity
- Compounds quickly

**Recommended Alternative:**
"Rent adjustments shall not exceed 5% per year and require 2 months advance written notice. Tenant may negotiate or terminate with 30 days notice if increase exceeds this limit."

**Legal Reference:**
Housing Lease Protection Act Article 7 (5% cap on increases).

---

## Medium Risk Clauses (중위험 조항)

### 6. Vague Special Conditions

**Problematic Example:**
"The tenant agrees to maintain the property in good condition."

**Issues:**
- "Good condition" is subjective
- No baseline established
- Disputes likely at move-out

**Recommended Alternative:**
"The tenant agrees to maintain the property in the condition documented by the move-in inspection checklist (Appendix A), accounting for normal wear and tear."

---

### 7. Restrictive Subletting Terms

**Problematic Example:**
"Subletting is strictly prohibited under any circumstances."

**Issues:**
- May conflict with legal rights
- No flexibility for emergencies
- Consider partial subletting

**Recommended Alternative:**
"Subletting requires landlord's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Partial subletting of unused rooms is permitted with 30 days notice."

---

### 8. Unclear Utility Responsibility

**Problematic Example:**
"Utilities are included."

**Issues:**
- No cap specified
- Disputes over excessive use
- Hidden costs possible

**Recommended Alternative:**
"Utilities (water, electricity, gas) are included up to [amount]/month. Excess usage shall be the tenant's responsibility, calculated based on utility company bills."

---

## Negotiation Scripts

### For Excessive Penalties:
"I understand the need for commitment protection, but a 50% penalty is unusual in the market. Could we agree on 10-15%, which is standard practice? I'm happy to provide longer notice period in exchange."

### For Unlimited Access:
"I appreciate your need to maintain the property, but I'd feel more comfortable with advance notice for inspections. Could we agree on 24-48 hours notice except for genuine emergencies?"

### For Delayed Deposit Return:
"Two months is quite long for deposit return. I'll need those funds for my next housing. Could we agree on 2 weeks, which would also show your confidence in the property's condition?"
